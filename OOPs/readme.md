# OOPs in Apex

## What does Object Oriented means ?
In relation to programming language,object oriented means that the code focuses on describing objects.Object can be anything that has unique characterstics,such as a person, people, flower
etc. Before truly understand about the object oriented means I need to understand about two things
Classes and Objects.

## Class in Apex :
A class is a blueprint.Objects are based on classes.A class defines a set of charaterstics and behaviours that are comman to all objects of that class.
Think about a student,it has charaterstics such as name,age,email,phone no and behaviour such as color, height, anger etc.
- Charaterstics are variables/properties.
- Behaviour are methods.

```
public class Student{
  //body of class
}
```

Classes are declared using four parts: the access modifier, the keyword "class", the class name, and the class body. The body (inside the curly braces { }Copy ), is where methods and variables of the class are defined.

An access modifier is a keyword in a class or method declaration. The access modifier determines what other Apex code can see and use the class or method. Although there are other access modifiers, publicCopy is the most common. Public classes are available to all other Apex classes within your org.
